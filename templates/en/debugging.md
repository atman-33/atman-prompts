# Debugging Assistance Prompt Template

Please help debug the following issue by following a systematic approach:

## Problem Analysis
- **Issue Description**: What is the expected vs actual behavior?
- **Error Messages**: Include any error messages, stack traces, or logs
- **Environment**: Operating system, language version, dependencies
- **Reproduction Steps**: How to consistently reproduce the issue
- **Recent Changes**: Any recent code or configuration changes

## Debugging Strategy
1. **Understand the Problem**: Clarify the issue and gather all relevant information
2. **Isolate the Issue**: Identify the specific component or code section causing the problem
3. **Form Hypotheses**: Develop theories about potential root causes
4. **Test Systematically**: Verify each hypothesis with targeted tests
5. **Implement Solution**: Apply the fix and verify it resolves the issue

## Investigation Areas
- **Code Logic**: Review algorithms and business logic
- **Data Flow**: Trace data through the system
- **Dependencies**: Check external libraries and services
- **Configuration**: Verify settings and environment variables
- **Resources**: Check memory, disk space, and network connectivity

## Output Format
Please provide:
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: What is causing the issue?
2. **Solution Steps**: Specific actions to resolve the problem
3. **Prevention**: How to avoid similar issues in the future
4. **Testing**: How to verify the fix works correctly

Include code examples and specific commands where applicable.
